# Weather App #


## Purpose ##

The sole purpose of this weather app is for practising and summing all the skills I acquired during the last weeks :

1. DOM JS Manipulation
2. Darkmode implementation
3. Async Function
4. API fetch
5. Interval JS
6. HTML / SASS Usage

## What is it ? ##

It is an application which by geolocalisation OR city search, can give you the weather and more details about it for the next five days.
It contains an autocomplete search and geolocalisation features.
